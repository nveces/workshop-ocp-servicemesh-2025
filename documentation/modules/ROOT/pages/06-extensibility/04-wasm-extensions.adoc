= Lab 2 - {waes}

== Introduction

=== {wasm}

{wasm} (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.

Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

The Wasm stack machine is designed to be encoded in a size and load-time efficient binary format.

{wasm} aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms.

{wasm} describes a memory-safe, sandboxed execution environment.

=== Envoy Wasm filter

An Envoy Wasm filter is a filter that _translates_ Envoy internal C\++ API to a Wasm engine via the Wasm ABI. Envoy supports Wasm filters for both the network pipeline as well as the HTTP pipeline (HTTP filters). It’s basically a thin plugin that delegates to a Wasm VM and Wasm module which means you can then write logic for the filter with Wasm (theoretically any language, not just C++).

Due to this model, the semantics of an Envoy Wasm filter are very similar to that of a native envoy filter.

An important point to note about this translation and delegation to Wasm is that Wasm is a sandboxed technology. From a security standpoint this is highly desirable but it has implications for the memory model. Any interaction with state between Envoy and the Wasm VM/your Wasm module  (manipulating headers and/or body) will be copied from Envoy memory to Wasm memory and back.

The Abstract Binary Interface (ABI) defines the contract of functions on both sides of the Wasm extension: for those exposed by the host and by those implemented by the Wasm module. The functions exposed by the host are _imported_ into the Wasm module while the functions implemented by the module are _exported_ by the Wasm module. A Wasm module implementing the functions in the ABI can be loaded to the Envoy Wasm filter and used as a _Wasm Envoy filter_.

=== {ossm} Extensions

You can use {wasm} plugins to add new features directly into the {rhossm} proxies, allowing you to move even more common functionality out of your applications, and implement them in a single language that compiles to {wasm} bytecode.

WebAssembly modules can be run on many platforms, including proxies, and has broad language support, fast execution and a sandboxed-by-default security model.

{ossm} extensions are Envoy HTTP Filters, giving them a wide range of capabilities:

* Manipulating the body and headers of requests and responses
* Out-of-band HTTP requests to services not in the request path, such as authentication or policy checking
* Side-channel data storage and queues for filters to communicate with each other

There are two parts to writing a {ossm} extension: you’ll have to write your extension using an SDK that exposes the proxy-wasm API and compile it to a {wasm} module, and then package it into a container.

==== Supported languages

You can use any language that compiles to {wasm} bytecode to write a {rhossm} extension, but the following languages have existing SDKs that expose the proxy-wasm API so that it can be consumed directly.

NOTE: In these labs, two {waes} written in Rust will be used.

==== Container Format
You must have a .wasm file containing the bytecode of your {wasm} module, and a manifest.yaml file in the root of the container filesystem to make your container image a valid extension image.

==== Deploying extensions
{ossm} extensions can be enabled using the {sme} resource. The following snippet is an example resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: header-append
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
  url: oci://quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.1
  phase: STATS
  priority: 100
  pluginConfig:
    first-header: some-value
    another-header: another-value
----

==== Support

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0 introduces support for WebAssembly extensions to Envoy Proxy. For this version WebAssembly extensions are introduced as a Tech Preview feature.

In OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1, the _ServiceMeshExtensions_ Custom Resource Definition (CRD), first introduced in 2.0 as Technology Preview, is now generally available. You can use CRD to build your own plugins, but Red Hat does not provide support for the plugins you create.

When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the WasmPlugin API. The ServiceMeshExtension API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.

== Modify the headers with a {wasm} filter

In this lab you will apply a previously developed {wasm} filter to your httpbin application.

Please, take a look at this repository for the source code of this filter:

https://github.com/acidonper/ossm-example-headers-extension[window="_blank"]

This Wasm filter will try to find a _Custom-Header_ header in the request message and, if found, replace it with two new headers: _Custom-Wasm-Header_ and _Custom-Wasm-Config-Header_. The value of the first one will be the same value of the original _Custom-Header_. The value of the second one will be picked up from the configuration of the {sme}.

This filter is already compiled so you don't have to setup a local Rust development environment but you can do so if you wish. The binary container image is already available here: https://quay.io/repository/acidonpe/ossm-example-headers-extension[window="_blank"]

This is the code where the actual header replacing takes place:

.Headers filter source code

It is important to take a look at the manifest packed in the container image:

[source,yaml]
----
schemaVersion: 1 <1>

name: ossm-example-headers-extension <2>
description: Replaces a custom header <3>
version: 1.0.0 <4>
phase: STATS <5>
priority: 100 <6>
module: extension.wasm <7>
----
<1> Used for versioning of the manifest schema. Currently the only possible value is 1.
<2> The name of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.
<3> The description of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.
<4> The version of your extension. This field is just metadata and currently unused.
<5> The default execution phase of your extension.
<6> The default priority of your extension. This is a required field.
<7> The relative path from the container filesystem’s root to your WebAssembly module. This is a required field.

Take a look also at the deployment manifest too:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: ossm-example-headers-extension
  namespace: test1-namespace <1>
spec:
  pluginConfig:
    my-key: my-wasm-value <2>
  url: oci://quay.io/acidonpe/ossm-example-headers-extension:1.0.0 <3>
  phase: STATS <4>
  priority: 100 <5>
  selector: <6>
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
----
<1> The _metadata.namespace_ of a _WasmPlugin_ source has a special semantic: if it equals the Control Plane Namespace, the extension will be applied to all workloads in the Service Mesh that match its _workloadSelector_. When deployed to any other Mesh Namespace, it will only be applied to workloads in that same Namespace.
<2> This is a pass-through field that will be handed over to the extension, so syntax and semantics are dependant on the extension you are deploying.
<3> A container image URI pointing to the image that holds the extension.
<4> The phase determines where in the filter chain the extension is injected, in relation to existing Istio functionality like Authentication, Authorization and metrics generation. Valid values are: "UNSPECIFIED_PHASE", "AUTHN", "AUTHZ" or "STATS".
<5> If multiple extensions with the same _spec.phase_ are applied to the same workload instance, the _spec.priority_ determines the ordering of execution. Extensions with higher priority will be executed first. This allows for inter-dependent extensions. This field defaults to the value set in the manifest.yaml of the extension, but can be overwritten by the user.
<6> The _spec.selector_ field has the same semantic as the _spec.selector_ field of the Istio Gateway resource. It will match a workload based on its Pod labels. If no _selector_ is specified, the extension will be applied to all workloads in the namespace.

=== Apply the {wasm} plugin

Now that you have httpbin running you can apply a {wasm} filter.

Execute the following command:

[source, terminal]
----
oc apply -f lab2/ossm-extension-headers.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

If everything works properly, it is possible to find the following log in the istio-proxy sidecar container executing the next procedure:

[source, terminal]
----
export HTTPBIN_POD=$(oc get pods --no-headers -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep httpbin)
oc logs $HTTPBIN_POD -c istio-proxy -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
...

----

As in the previous lab, you are going to query the httpbin _anything_ endpoint using an additional custom header:

[source,bash]
----
curl -k -H "My-Header: my-value" "https://${OCP_HTTPBIN_HOST}/anything"
----

As you can see, _httpbin_ app returns a JSON with everything that was passed in the request, including your custom header but nothing has been changed:

.httpbin returns a custom header
image::httpbin_wasm_header_1.png[]

Now, use the _Custom-Header_ the extension is expecting:

[source,bash]
----
curl -k -H "Custom-Header: my-value" "https://${OCP_HTTPBIN_HOST}/anything"
----

As you can see now, _Custom-Header_ has been replaced with _Custom-Wasm-Header_ and _Custom-Wasm-Config-Header_. Notice that the value of _Custom-Wasm-Header_ is the original value of _Custom-Header_ and the value of _Custom-Wasm-Config-Header_ is taken from the {sme} deployment manifest:

.{wasm} plugin replaces the custom header
image::httpbin_wasm_header_2.png[]

=== Remove the extension

Remove the {wasm} plugin before starting the next example:

[source, terminal]
----
oc delete -f lab2/ossm-extension-headers.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

== Modify the body with a {wasm} filter

As with the previous example, in this lab you will apply a previously developed {wasm} filter to your httpbin application. In this case, the extension will modify the body of the response message.

Please, take a look at this repository for the source code of this filter:

https://github.com/acidonper/ossm-example-body-extension[window="_blank"]

This Wasm filter will try to find a specif text in the response body. This text will be provided using the _config_ field in the {sme} resource. If the extension finds this exact text within the response body it will omit the body and will replace it with an alternative text.

This filter is already compiled so you don't have to setup a local Rust development environment but you can do so if you wish. The binary container image is already available here: https://quay.io/repository/acidonpe/ossm-example-body-extension[window="_blank"]

This is the code where the actual body replacing takes place:

.Body filter source code
image::wasm_body_code.png[]

Take a look at the deployment {sme} resource:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: ossm-example-body-extension
spec:
  pluginConfig:
    secret-word: secret <1>
  url: oci://quay.io/acidonpe/ossm-example-body-extension:1.0.0
  priority: 100
  phase: STATS
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
----
<1> This is the specific text the extension will try to find

=== Apply the {wasm} plugin

Now you can apply the {wasm} plugin.

Execute the following command:

[source, terminal]
----
oc apply -f lab2/ossm-extension-body.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

If everything works properly, it is possible to find the following log in the istio-proxy sidecar container executing the next procedure:

[source, terminal]
----
export HTTPBIN_POD=$(oc get pods --no-headers -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep httpbin)
oc logs $HTTPBIN_POD -c istio-proxy -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
...
2023-08-30T11:51:46.862406Z info wasm fetching image acidonpe/ossm-example-body-extension from registry quay.io with tag 1.0.0
----

As in the previous lab, you are going to query the httpbin _anything_ endpoint but this time using a custom body:

[source,bash]
----
curl -k -d "My message" "https://${OCP_HTTPBIN_HOST}/anything"
----

As you can see, _httpbin_ app returns a JSON with everything that was passed in the request, including your custom body but nothing special happened:

.httpbin returns a custom body
image::httpbin_wasm_body_1.png[]

Now, include the word _secret_ in the body, as defined in the {sme} resource:

[source,bash]
----
curl -k -d "My secret message" "https://${OCP_HTTPBIN_HOST}/anything"
----

As you can see now, the extension has detected the word in the body and has replaced all the body with a predefined message:

.{wasm} plugin replaces body
image::httpbin_wasm_body_2.png[]

=== Remove the extension

Remove the {wasm} plugin to finish the lab:

[source, terminal]
----
oc delete -f lab2/ossm-extension-body.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----
