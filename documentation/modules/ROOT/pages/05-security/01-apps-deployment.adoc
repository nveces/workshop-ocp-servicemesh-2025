:toc-title: Setup demo applications

[Abstract]
The main goal of this lab is to quickly deploy a set of applications that will be used in the next labs. Notice that in this case, all `Deployments` are properly annotated, so the `istio-proxy` is autoinjected magically. 


We will deploy the `bookinfo` app we are already familiar with, but we will do it in 2 different `namespaces` so we can then have some different scenarios to test.

The final set of application deployments will look like follows:

== Deploy services in $APPS_NS1

Let's have all services up and running in $APPS_NS1. 

We will start with `produtcpage` service. Run:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/productpage-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

service/productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
....

One thing that is important during these labs, mainly for the `authorization` part, is the `ServiceAccount`. In the above command output, notice:

....
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
....

This `serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage` will be used to run the `productpage pods`,  so every application will run using different `ServiceAccounts` and that would mean different identities, as will see later. 

To verify the above, check that within the `deployment.apps/productpage-v1` we have set the `serviceAccount`:

....
$ oc get deployment.apps/productpage-v1 -n $APPS_NS1 -o yaml | grep "serviceAccount: bookinfo-productpage"

      serviceAccount: bookinfo-productpage
....

NOTE: In regular deployments, if serviceAccount field is not set, pods will run with the `default` ServiceAccount, which is pre-created for us when creating new projects/namespaces. 

Let's continue with `details` service:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/details-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

service/details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
....

Then, `reviews`:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/reviews-v2.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

service/reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
....

And finally `ratings`:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/ratings-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

service/ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
....

We are almost done in `$APPS_NS1`, but before creating the `VirtualServices` and `DestinationRules` for every service, let's check that we get all pods running with '2/2' containers:

....
$ oc get pods  -n $APPS_NS1

NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-797b75485d-7ml49       2/2     Running   0          5m25s
productpage-v1-5f6774b864-5p4ms   2/2     Running   0          10h
ratings-v1-7d48bbb9fd-znfdd       2/2     Running   0          2m32s
reviews-v2-cf45c87c7-74jbh        2/2     Running   0          3m5s
....

Execute the following commands to create the `VirtualServices` and `DestinationRules` for every service. We leave the `productpage` configuration for the end, as it is a bit special. The other services will have a simple `VirtualService`that reference a single subset defined in the `DestinationRule`. Run the following for `details` service:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/details-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/details created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
....

Feel free to check the content of both `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule` we just created. 
Then, do the same for `reviews`:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/reviews-v2.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
....

And finally `ratings`:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/ratings-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
....

In the case of the `productpage` service, two more objects are created:

- a `Route`, so the service can be externally accesible. Notice that it will be a secure route (simple `tls`) with passthrough termination. This means that the `tls` termination is not performed at the router side but the ingress gateway instead.
- an ingress `Gateway`, that will use an specific `selector` so the configuration will be applied on your $INGRESS_GW (in previous labs/workshops, we all shared the same gateway pods, but in these labs, we will have an specific gateway deployment per user). There is also some `tls` config set to include a pre-created set of certificates for this labs (under `apps-credential Secret`).

To double check and understand what we just described above, run the following command and inspect the output YAML (try to see all details from the `Route` and `Gateway`):

....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/productpage-v1.yaml -p PRODUCTPAGE_HOST=$PRODUCTPAGE_HOST -p INGRESS_GW=$INGRESS_GW -p APPS_NS=$APPS_NS1 -p MESH_NS=$SERVICE_MESH_NS -o yaml
....

Once reviewed, apply the manifests:

....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/productpage-v1.yaml -p PRODUCTPAGE_HOST=$PRODUCTPAGE_HOST -p INGRESS_GW=$INGRESS_GW -p APPS_NS=$APPS_NS1 -p MESH_NS=$SERVICE_MESH_NS -o yaml | oc apply -f - 

route.route.openshift.io/dsanchor-ingress-productpage created
gateway.networking.istio.io/dsanchor-ingress-productpage created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
....


Get the accesible endpoint of the application:

....
$ oc get route/${INGRESS_GW}-productpage -o template='http://{{.spec.host}}' -n istio-system

http://productpage-dsanchor-1.apps.labs.sandbox671.opentlc.com
....

Test the application in your `Web browser`. You will be redirected to an `https` url and warned about the self-signed certificate we have configured:

image:self-signed-cert.png[Self signed cert]

Accept the risk ;-) and you will land in the following page:

image:landing-page.png[Landing page]

Click on `Access to productpage` link (bottom left of the page) and voila:

image:productpage.png[Productpage]

Keep a test running on the background to generate telemetry (don't forget to use your domain in the url):

....
watch -n1 curl -k https://${PRODUCTPAGE_HOST}/productpage
....

If you check then the graph in `Kiali`, you should get a similar flow:

image:first-graph.gif[First graph]

Notice the starting node in the graph... it should be your dedicated ingress gateway.


== Deploy services in $APPS_NS2

For a different scenario that will be later introduced, we will deploy just the `reviews` and `ratings` service in $APPS_NS2. 

Deploy `reviews-v3`:
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/reviews-v3.yaml -n $APPS_NS2

service/reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
....

And then `ratings-v1`:
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/apps/ratings-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS2

service/ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
....

Create the specific set of `VirtualServices` and `DestinationRules`:

For `reviews`:
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/reviews-v3.yaml -n $APPS_NS2

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
....

For `ratings`:
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/istio/ratings-v1.yaml -n $APPS_NS2

virtualservice.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
....

So far, we just deployed and configured some services in $APPS_NS2, but these are not yet accesible. The current request flow looks like:

image:apps-ns1-workflow.png[Apps ns1 workflow]

But in some scenarios during these labs, we want to make use of the services we have deployed on $APPS_NS2 as in next diagram:

image:apps-ns2-workflow.png[Apps ns2 workflow]

In order to achieve this, we will have to set certain `env variable` in `productpage` to target to a different `reviews` service than the default one (same namespace). Execute the following to configure the `reviews` service in $APPS_NS2 as target service:

....
$ oc set env deployment/productpage-v1 -e REVIEWS_HOSTNAME=reviews.$APPS_NS2.svc.cluster.local -n $APPS_NS1

deployment.apps/productpage-v1 updated
....

A rollout of `productpage`is triggered and then, test the service again. You should get the `ratings` with red stars:

image:ratings-ns2.png[Ratings from ns2] 

And if you keep sending requests.. you would get the following graph (notice that we jump from `productpage` in your $APPS_NS1 to `reviews` in your $APPS_NS2):

image:graph-with-ns2.gif[Graph with ns2]

Once tested, we will move back to default, as we will start from the first scenario, where all services run in $APPS_NS1.

Execute the following to move back to default `reviews` service, which runs in same `namespace`:

....
$ oc set env deployment/productpage-v1 -e REVIEWS_HOSTNAME=reviews -n $APPS_NS1

deployment.apps/productpage-v1 updated
....

It is time to start securing our services calls as in this lab, we have just deployed all services and securely exposed externally (simple tls) but we did nothing about this within the mesh (so internal calls still are not secured with tls/mtls).
