:toc-title: Lab 0 - Warming up

[Abstract]

WARNING: This is not a recommended practices guide nor intended to serve as a reference. These series of labs are oriented in such a way that you will have a first contact to the main concepts of Openshift Service Mesh and Istio *security topics*.


In this preparation lab, we are going to get the `oc` cli binary and validate that all necessary requirements are successfully accomplished before starting the series of labs.

Along these labs, you will refer to a list of variables that have been shared with you before starting the labs. If this is not your case, please let us know.

These variables are:

- *$OCP_CONSOLE*: url for accessing to the Openshift web console
- *$OCP_API*: Openshift API endpoint. We will use this endpoint when accesing the cluster from the `oc` cli.
- *$USER*: your private user id used for Openshift authentication
- *$PASSWORD*:  your secret password used for Openshift authentication
- *$APPS_NS1* and *$APPS_NS2* : namespaces where you will deploy your apps during the whole series of labs. Ex: `dsanchor-1` and `dsanchor-2`
- *$SERVICE_MESH_NS*: namespace of the Istio Control Plane you will be using. This time, there will be only a single control plane shared by all: `istio-system`.
- *$KIALI_CONSOLE*: each Service Mesh will have their own console. Use this url to access to the `Kiali console`.
- *$INGRESS_GW*: every user will have a dedicated Ingress Gateway to manage his/her ingress traffic. Ex: `dsanchor-ingress`
- *$PRODUCTPAGE_HOST*: external domain for the productpage service. Ex: `productpage-dsanchor-1.apps.labs.sandbox671.opentlc.com`


Feel free to export these variables in your environment.

There is also a list of files needed to run the labs. These files can be found in the following github repository:

https://github.com/dsanchor/service-mesh-security

Clone the repository to your desired location, that will then be referred as *$LABS_HOME* during the labs:

....
$ git clone https://github.com/dsanchor/service-mesh-security.git $LABS_HOME
....

== Access to Openshift Web Console

Use the `*$OCP_CONSOLE*` url to acces the Openshift Web Console.

A login screen will be shown as follow:

image:05-security/login.png[login,link=../_images/05-security/login.png,window=_blank]

Enter your `username` and `password` and click `Log In`.

If you have successfully logged in, you will arrive to the main dashboard with your current projects. As seen below, you should have access to 3 namespaces, `istio-system`, `yournamespace-1` and `yournamespace-2`:

It is time to get the Openshift CLI binaries for your specific OS.

=== Download the CLI

On the top-right (?) menu, click on `Command line tools`:

image:05-security/menu-clt.png[command-line-tools,link=../_images/05-security/menu-clt.png,window=_blank]

Then, choose the binaries according to your OS:

image:05-security/cli-download-options.png[cli-download-options,link=../_images/05-security/cli-download-options.png,window=_blank]

Extract the binaries and try it by executing the following:

....
$ oc version

Client Version: 4.7.5
Server Version: 4.7.5
Kubernetes Version: v1.20.0+bafe72f

....

The above is an example of what you should get when running the command.

=== Access to Openshift using `oc`

Once we have the `oc` cli tool installed, we will first log in into the platform by running:

_Notice that we are using the $VARS we mentioned at the beggining of the labs. If you have not exported them, you will need to manually replace them below._

....
$ oc login -u $USER -p $PASSWORD $OCP_API

Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with ' project <projectname>':

  * istio-system
    dsanchor-1
    dsanchor-2

Using project "istio-system".
....


== Access to Service Mesh Console: Kiali

Use the `*$KIALI_CONSOLE*` url to acces the Service Mesh Web Console.

A login screen will be shown as follow:

image:05-security/kiali-login.png[Kiali login,link=../_images/05-security/kiali-login.png,window=_blank]

Enter your `username` and `password` and click `Log In`.

If you have successfully logged in, you will arrive to the main dashboard where you will see the main `Service Mesh Control Plane` namespace and your two `Apps namespaces`:


05-security/kiali-projects.png[Kiali mesh and namespaces]

Notice that this time, your two `Apps namespaces` are already part of the mesh, that is, we simply added the `ServiceMeshMember` for you, as you have done this task many times in previous labs.

We can now start deploying applications into our project so we are then ready to start securing them.
