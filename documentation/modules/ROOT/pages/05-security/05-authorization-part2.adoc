:toc-title: Authorization: part 2

[Abstract]
In this last lab, we will first introduce one way of managing the JWT and the OAuth2 integration flow with Google's OAuth server, so we don't have to manually get a token.

Then, we will create a new authorization scenario that will use the `end-user` identity and different claims from the JWT.

== Extra: OAuth flow implementation

As mentioned in lab 4, Istio provides just an authentication and authorization mechanism for JWT, but it does not provide anything to help obtaning the JWT token.

This implementation shown in this section is *just an example*. In a few words, we will use an `ext_auth` type `EnvoyFilter` that will intercept every call at ingress level and forward it to an `oauth2-proxy`. that will manage the integration with Google OAuth server. It is based on https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy[oauth2-proxy] project, although in our case, it won't act as a proxy, but a *simple oauth helper beside our service mesh*.

Next diagram shows all the interactions between all pieces involved (I have skipped the Openshift Router, so I only focus on elements once entering in the Service Mesh).

Another possiblity would be to implement this mechanism with a WebAssembly module (WASM). This https://github.com/dgn/oidc-filter[project] could be used as a good starting point.

=== Deploy an OAuth2 proxy (helper)

Let's now put all we have described above in practice. First, we need to deploy an `oauth2-proxy` that will be used to manage the OAuth2 workflow.

We will deploy it under our $APPS_NS1:
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/oauth2-proxy.yaml -p INGRESS_GW=$INGRESS_GW -p APP_DOMAIN=$PRODUCTPAGE_HOST -p CLIENT_ID="805248467061-9nkgmsfmdu3me5d4ngiemvb1en3s550b.apps.googleusercontent.com" -p CLIENT_SECRET="-RPI_Pgs_IKn0sIkYiB_7DAn" -p COOKIE_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 16) -p OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://accounts.google.com OAUTH_NS=$APPS_NS1 -n $APPS_NS1 | oc apply -f - -n $APPS_NS1

secret/oauth2-proxy created
service/oauth2-proxy created
deployment.apps/oauth2-proxy created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/oauth2-proxy created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/oauth2-proxy created
serviceentry.networking.istio.io/accounts-google created
serviceentry.networking.istio.io/oauth2-googleapis created

....

NOTE: There were some basic objects created that you are familiar to as in any regular OCP+Mesh application deployment: `Service`, `Deployment`, `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule`. Then, there are two `ServiceEntries` that have been created in order to allow access to external resources which are Google's related. This is because we have restricted the access to any external resource from within the `Service Mesh` (as we are in the Security Workshop, we would like to have certain control to which external resources are consumed). To achieve this goal, we configured our `ServiceMeshControlPlane` with a `REGISTRY_ONLY` `outboutTrafficPolicy` https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/[mode]. Feel free to have a look at the configuration and the `ServiceEntries` as well.

If may take some restarts to have the application running since the `oauth2-proxy` container tries to load the OIDC configuration from an external resource and the `istio-proxy` may not have started yet. Finally, you should see a similar output on the `oauth2-proxy` contatiner within the pod:
....
[2021/04/03 20:49:58] [proxy.go:59] mapping path "/" => static response 200
[2021/04/03 20:49:58] [oauthproxy.go:137] OAuthProxy configured for OpenID Connect Client ID: 805248467061-9nkgmsfmdu3me5d4ngiemvb1en3s550b.apps.googleusercontent.com
[2021/04/03 20:49:58] [oauthproxy.go:143] Cookie settings: name:_oauth2_proxy_dsanchor-ingress secure(https):true httponly:true expiry:4h0m0s domains: path:/ samesite:lax refresh:after 30m0s
[2021/04/03 20:49:58] [http.go:57] HTTP: listening on 0.0.0.0:4180
....

Then, we will configure an `EnvoyFilter` on our dedicated ingress `Gateway` that will intercept every call entering the mesh. We will use an `ext_authz` filter. Run the following:
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/oauth2-envoy-filter.yaml -p INGRESS_GW=$INGRESS_GW -p OAUTH_NS=$APPS_NS1 -n istio-system | oc apply -f - -n istio-system

envoyfilter.networking.istio.io/dsanchor-ingress created
....

Test the application now.

You will first be redirected to select your gmail account:

image:05-security/google-account-selection.png[Google account selection,link=../_images/05-security/google-account-selection.png,window=_blank]

And once you have selected your preferred account, you will land into the bookinfo application.

Just to mention, any google account would be valid for this test... you can try if you have different ones (Ex: @gmail or your corporate account).

We will add some more specific `AuthorizationPolicies` now.

== Configure RequestAuthentication in $APPS_NS1

First step before creating any `AuthorizationPolicy` that uses any related data/attribute from the JWT token is to set a `RequestAuthentication` that would cover the scope of the workload (For instance, we already did it for the dedicated ingress `Gateway`).

We will now create a namespace-wide `RequestAuthentication` for $APPS_NS1 namespace. Run the following command:
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/apps-ns-request-authentication.yaml -p APPS_NS=$APPS_NS1 OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://accounts.google.com OIDC_JWKS_URI=https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs -n $APPS_NS1  | oc apply -f - -n $APPS_NS1

requestauthentication.security.istio.io/dsanchor-1-request-authentication created
....

As any other resource we create on the cluster, I encourage you to have a look at what you have exactly created. For instance, this time you could run:
....
$ oc get requestauthentication.security.istio.io/$APPS_NS1-request-authentication -o yaml -n $APPS_NS1

apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: dsanchor-1-request-authentication
  namespace: dsanchor-1
spec:
  jwtRules:
  - forwardOriginalToken: true
    issuer: https://accounts.google.com
    jwksUri: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs
....

== Limit access based on hosted domain claim

One of the claims that could be used to limit access to certain resources could be the `hosted domain` or `hd`.

To understand what a `hosted domain` is, please, feel free to read about it https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/openid-connect#hd-param[here].

Also, let's put the `rbac` log level to `debug` on your dedicated ingress `Gateway`, so we will be able to see all the info we get from the JWT (and all the claims that can be used as a `rule condition`, such as the `hd`):
....
$ oc exec -n istio-system $(oc get pods -n istio-system  -o name  | grep $INGRESS_GW) -c istio-proxy -- curl -X POST localhost:15000/logging?rbac=debug
....

And now, run some tests again your application and check the logs from your dedicated ingress `Gateway`. What claims do you see for your user? What's the hd you see from your user?

TIP: Try to find the `request.auth.claims` attribute in logs. And there, you should find an `hd` attribute. An example of an `hd` would be `redhat.com` for email addresses like dsanchor@redhat.com

The `hd` is hihgly dependant on the user account you have choosen. For instance, if you chose an `@gmail` you won't see any `hd`. Instead, use your corporate account to get a valid `hd`.

TIP: If you already logged in with an @gmail.com account or you want to log with a different account, use the https://${PRODUCTPAGE_HOST}/oauth2/start to trigger a new login process.

You can see the logs by executing the following command:
....
$ oc logs -f -n istio-system $(oc get pods -n istio-system  -o name  | grep $INGRESS_GW)
....

We will use the `hd` we have just discovered to create a new `AuthorizationPolicy` (*now on, we will use $HD to refer it, export it*):
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/hd-policy.yaml -p HD=$HD -n $APPS_NS1 | oc apply -f - -n $APPS_NS1

authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io/productpage-hd created
....

Test first with a user/account that belongs to that `hosted domain`.

Once you have verified that it works, try using a different account that does not belong to that `hosted domain` (for instance, a @gmail.com account). It should not have access to the bookinfo application.

Also, feel free to share your $PRODUCTPAGE_HOST with a colleague and let him test the application with his own account (which belongs to your same `hosted domain`). It should also work.

Finally, remove the policy we just created to avoid conflicts in next lab:
....
$ oc delete authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io/productpage-hd -n $APPS_NS1

authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io "productpage-hd" deleted
....

As summary of this lab, we just learnt how to limit access to our services for a given corporation or hosted domain users.

== Limit access to your user only

In this last lab, we will limit access to the application to only your user account.

First, let's get your user account, so we can set it as a valid `requestPrincipal`. To obtain it, check your dedicated ingress `Gateway` logs and try to find the `request.auth.principal` attribute. Just one tip, it will be similar to this example: https://accounts.google.com/104396212601495701298.

*Assign the value of  `request.auth.principal` to the $USER_ACCOUNT variable* that will be used next.

See how your new policy will look like:
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/request-principal-policy.yaml -p USER_ACCOUNT=$USER_ACCOUNT -o yaml -n $APPS_NS1
...
...
(just focus on the spec part of the object)
  spec:
    rules:
    - from:
      - source:
          requestPrincipals:
          - https://accounts.google.com/104396212601495701298
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: productpage
....

Create the policy then:
....
$ oc process -f $LABS_HOME/lab5/request-principal-policy.yaml -p USER_ACCOUNT=$USER_ACCOUNT -n $APPS_NS1 | oc apply -f - -n $APPS_NS1

authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io/productpage-request-principal created
....

Test the application again using the account you have choosen as $USER_ACCOUNT.

Then, ask your colleague again to test your application under your $PRODUCTPAGE_HOST. This time, he won't be able to access it.

We just have given access to a certain user. Feel free to add more users to the list of requestPrincipals (for instance, the one from your colleague and let him test your application).
