[Abstract]
In this lab, we are going to configure mTLS for all comunications between our existing services.

One of the possibilities would be to `auto enable` mTLS globally in the `mesh` during the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` installation process.

In our case, we chose not to do it that way, so we can reach this lab and enable mTLS in each service to service communication as an exercise to practice with this kind of scenarios.

NOTE: This lab about mTLS is very similar to the one we did in *Service Mesh - Introduction*, but it is required to move to next labs and also, good to remember what we did and how we did it.  This time, we will apply the configuration in a few steps only.


:numbered:
== Enforce mTLS in our namespace $APPS_NS1

First, we are going to enforce that any service to service communication in our `namespace` is covered by mTLS.

To do so, we will create a https://istio.io/v1.6/docs/reference/config/security/peer_authentication/[PeerAuthentication] object that set the mTLS mode to `strict`:

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab2/peer-authentication-strict.yaml -n $APPS_NS1

peerauthentication.security.istio.io/peer-auth-policy created
....

WARNING: When setting PeerAuthentication to STRICT namespace wide, we will get an error in `Kiali` telling that "Destination Rule enabling namespace-wide mTLS is missing". In our case, we don't really care, as in this lab, we will enable mTLS service by service in the namespace.

*Ignore it for the rest of the lab.*


Test your application again. It does not work anymore. You should get an error like this one:

....
upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection termination
....

And that is because we are enforcing mTLS and our services have not been configured to support it yet.

To do so, we will take advantage of an interesting `Istio` feature wich is the `ISTIO_MUTUAL` traffic policy: we let the proxy serves an `Istio` managed certificate associated per `ServiceAccount` to have mTLS without any change in our application.

This `ServiceAccount` per service will let us identify the caller independently as each `ServiceAccount` will have a certificate associated to it. We will debug a bit to understand what happens under the covers.

== Configure mTLS in our services under $APPS_NS1

What will do next is to start setting `ISTIO_MUTUAL` in our services. We will achieve it by adding a `trafficPolicy` section of the `DestinationRule` where will describe the `tls mode`. In this case, it will be set to `ISTIO_MUTUAL`.

Let's first understand the changes that we are going to apply in every `DestinationRule`. For that, we will get one before applying any change:

....
$  oc get destinationrule/productpage -o yaml -n $APPS_NS1
...
 (let's focus on the spec part of it)
...
 spec:
  host: productpage
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: v1
....

Apply the changes:
....
$ oc patch destinationrule/productpage --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS1

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage patched
....

And get again the same `DestinatioRule` to see the `trafficPolicy` section that has been added:

....
$  oc get destinationrule/productpage -o yaml -n $APPS_NS1
...
 (let's focus on the spec part of it)
...
spec:
  host: productpage
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: v1
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
....

We do the same for every service. Patch the one for `details`:

....
$ oc patch destinationrule/details --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS1

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details patched
....

Then `reviews`:

....
$ oc patch destinationrule/reviews --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS1

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews patched
....

And last from $APPS_NS1 is `ratings`:

....
$ oc patch destinationrule/ratings --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS1

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings patched
....

Test the application again and check that is working fine. You can also leave some tests running (don't forget to change to your domain:

....
watch -n1 curl -k https://${PRODUCTPAGE_HOST}/productpage
....

Finally, move to `Kiali` and select the `Security` check box in the graph `Display options`. We should get a lock icon between each service call:

== Enforce mTLS and configure services in $APPS_NS2

We will apply the same changes in $APPS_NS2:

- Create a `PeerAuthentication` with STRICT mode
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab2/peer-authentication-strict.yaml -n $APPS_NS2

peerauthentication.security.istio.io/peer-auth-policy created
....

- Set `ISTIO_MUTUAL` in every service.

....
$ oc patch destinationrule/reviews --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS2

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews patched
....

....
$ oc patch destinationrule/ratings --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"trafficPolicy":{"tls":{"mode":"ISTIO_MUTUAL"}}}}' -n $APPS_NS2

destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings patched
....

We have now finished setting mTLS between all our services calls. We can move now to the first part of the `authorization` labs.


== Optional: add namespace-wide DestinationRule for mTLS

In case you want to get rid of the `PeerAuthentication` *validation error*, you could create a `DestinationRule` that would cover all your services in the `namespace` with mTLS (As you could have checked already, all our services are fully working and have mTLS. We have set it individually instead, but if the validation error really annoys you, feel free to remove it).

This is the  YAML file you could use as template, replace $APPS_NS with your `namespace` before applying (you must do it with both $APPS_NS1 and $APPS_NS2):
....
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: enable-mtls-ns-wide
  namespace: ${APPS_NS}
spec:
  host: "*.${APPS_NS}.svc.cluster.local"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
....
