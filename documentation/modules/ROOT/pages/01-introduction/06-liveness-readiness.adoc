:toc-title: Liveness and readiness

[Abstract]
In this lab, we will introduce the concept of application health checking by configuring both liveness and readiness probes.

A startup probe has been added recently, but we will not consider it in this lab.

:numbered:
== What and why

To answers these two questions, what are liveness/readiness probes? why are they needed? read the next article (10 minutes) that will give through different examples and scenarios the response to both questions: https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/you-probably-need-liveness-and-readiness-probes/

== Configure liveness and readiness

=== Application endpoints

Our application, which is based on Quarkus, provides a built-in health check endpoints when including `quarkus-smallrye-health` extension (for more detailes, see how it is done in our example application https://github.com/dsanchor/petclinic/blob/mnl-config/quarkus-petclinic/pom.xml#L73[here]).

Before configuring any probe, let's try both health checks (liveness/readiness) endpoints manually to see the actual responses.

Since the  application is externally exposed, we can easily test them.

- Liveness endpoint:
....
curl -v http://<APP_HOST_PORT>/health/live

..
..
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
    ]
}
...
...
....

- Readiness endpoint:
....
curl -v http://<APP_HOST_PORT>/health/ready

..
..
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connections health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
...
...
....

As you could have noticed, there is an additional check added in the readiness probe response. That check comes from the Database connection, so in case there is a problem between the application and the Database, the readiness probe would fail and the pod will not receive traffic.

In our case, this is what we want: different liveness and readiness checks.

=== Modify current deployment

We will add both liveness and readiness probe to the existing deployment. To do so, we will use the `web console` and then examine the YAML descriptor.

Using the `Developer` view, click on the `quarkus-petclinic` application, and then `Add Health Check`:

image:add-hc.png[add hc]

Then, configure both `liveness` and `readiness` probe.

Important:

- put the right `path` in the right `probe` :-)
- add an `initial delay` that covers p99 startup time (check the container log trace "started in X.YYYs. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080" to get a more accurate amount of time)

Save each probe individually and click on `Add`.

This change will force a new rolling update of our `pods`. New `pods` will now have both probes set.

The changes applied to the existing `Deployment` are highlighted next:

image:yaml-hc.png[yaml hc]

There should not be any issue and both probes should have passed successfully: application is healthy.

Let's now force the `readiness probe` to fail. To do so, we will scale the Database down to zero replicas:

....
oc scale dc/petclinic-database --replicas=0 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/petclinic-database scaled
....

Once the Database pod is gone, check both `logs` and `events` in the application pod:

*Logs*
image:logs-hc.png[logs]

*Events*
image:events-hc.png[events]

Manually test the readiness probe to see the current response:
....
curl -v http://<APP_HOST_PORT>/health/ready

..
..
{
    "status": "DOWN",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connections health check",
            "status": "DOWN",
            "data": {
                "default": "Unable to execute the validation check for the default DataSource: This connection has been closed."
            }
        }

    ]
}
...
...
....

Check the readiness of the application `pods` and see there is `0/1` containers ready:

....
$ oc get pods -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
NAME                                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
petclinic-database-1-deploy          0/1     Completed   0          7h34m
quarkus-petclinic-79d56759f5-q8vwc   0/1     Running     0          18m
....

And finally.. try to access to the application again... :-(


In order to make the application back to `Ready`, scale up the Database to 1:

....
oc scale dc/petclinic-database --replicas=1 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

petclinic-database scaled
....

Wait until the Database is back and try to access to the application again.

Everything should be back to normal.
