:toc-title: First application deployment

[Abstract]
Once this lab is completed, we will have successfully deployed our first application and we will also have made it externally accesible.

The main goals of this lab is to understand some core concepts such as:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployments]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Services]
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/rest_api/network_apis/route-route-openshift-io-v1.html[Routes]

== Brief application description

The application that we are going to use during these labs is called *Pet clinic*. It has been used in different workshops in Red Hat.

In our case, we have made some modifications to make it more appropiate to certain use cases we wanted to show during the labs.

Next diagram describes the 3 layer application architecture:

image:01-introduction/app-arch.png[app-arch,link=../_images/01-introduction/app-arch.png,window=_blank]

It basically manage set of Pets, their Owners and Veterinarians appointments. We will play a bit when needed in the labs.

Source code is available https://github.com/dsanchor/petclinic.git[here].

NOTE: As these labs are not intended to be a development nor Quarkus workshop, I will not give more details about the application itself unless they are related to Openshift integration.

== Deploy application

There are many ways of performing our first deployment (web console, cli options and so on), but I want to start by creating the first deployment using the YAML descriptor.

Let's have a look at the full YAML file first:
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: quarkus-petclinic
  labels:
    app: quarkus-petclinic
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: quarkus-petclinic
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 25%
      maxSurge: 25%
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: quarkus-petclinic
        deployment: quarkus-petclinic
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: quarkus-petclinic
          image: 'quay.io/dsanchor/quarkus-petclinic:in-mem'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          resources: {}
          imagePullPolicy: Always
----

Let's focus on each individual parts:

First part, there is basically the `kind` and `apiVersion` for a `Deployment` API object and then, we just add a name and a set of `labels` under `metadata`:

image:01-introduction/d-name.png[deployment name,link=../_images/01-introduction/d-name.png,window=_blank]

Next, we have the `spec` part of the object. This is where we basically define the desired state of our `Deployment`.

Grouping some parts of it, we have:

image:01-introduction/d-part1.png[deployment part1,link=../_images/01-introduction/d-part1.png,window=_blank]

- Number of desired pods managed by this `Deployment` and its `ReplicaSet`
- Selector, that will basically tell which pods are managed by the `ReplicaSet`.
- Deployment strategy, which set how pods are created/destroy during update process.

And finally the template definition, that describes how a pod will look like:

image:01-introduction/d-part2.png[deployment part2,link=../_images/01-introduction/d-part2.png,window=_blank]

We will see more details about every part of the `pod` itself while going through the labs.

=== Create our first deployment in your project

As said, we will apply the YAML descriptor into our project. To do so, execute:

----
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/app-deployment.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic created
----

NOTE: You can move to one project to another with `oc project <PROJECT>` and there is no need to add the extra `-n <PROJECT>` to perform actions over the current `project`, although when having many `projects`, the `-n` option will give you the peace and serenity about being doing stuff where you really want to :-)

Let's also have a look at what has been created already in our project:

----
$ oc get all -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/quarkus-petclinic-7cdcd76595-vrbd2   1/1     Running   0          2m33s

NAME                                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic   1/1     1            1           2m33s

NAME                                           DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/quarkus-petclinic-7cdcd76595   1         1         1       2m33s

----

We have not only a `Deployment` but a `ReplicaSet` and a single `Pod`.

By creating a `Deployment`, a `ReplicaSet` has been created in order to ensure that the specified number of pods are running at a given moment in time.

Let's move to the console and see what we have. This time, we will use the `Developer` view. Select that perspective on the left top corner:

image:01-introduction/just-deployment.png[just deployment,link=../_images/01-introduction/just-deployment.png,window=_blank]

If you click on the blue circle (2), you will get all details about the application (3).

As you can tell, there is not any `Service` nor `Route` created for it yet. That means, this application is just locally accesible if you would know the pod ip (unprobable.. and undesired).

Click on the `pod` link (4) and get a terminal screen within that `pod`:

image:01-introduction/pod-terminal.png[pod terminal,link=../_images/01-introduction/pod-terminal.png,window=_blank]

To test the application locally, execute the following in the terminal:
....
$ curl -v localhost:8080 | grep 200
....

NOTE: In case you did not get a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response, let us know.

=== Add a service to your application

Once we tested the application, lets add a `Service` that will provide us a logical name to access to this application. It will also be used as a load balancer for the possible 'n' pods we may have later for this `Deployment`.

....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/app-service.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

service/quarkus-petclinic created
....

Alternatively, you could have ran the next `oc` command:
....
oc expose deployment/quarkus-petclinic --port=8080 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
....

Feel free to run again a _oc get all_ to see that the service has been successfully created.

Also, if you move back to the console, you will notice that the service is "assigned" to the application:

image:01-introduction/with-service.png[with service,link=../_images/01-introduction/with-service.png,window=_blank]

Test the application again from the `pod` terminal, but this time use the `service` name instead:

....
$ curl -v quarkus-petclinic:8080 | grep 200
....

Hope you got a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`! If that is the case, let's make our application externally acessible by adding a `route`.

=== Create a route

Apply the following YAML in your project:
....
$ oc apply -f $LABS_HOME/lab1/app-route.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

route.route.openshift.io/quarkus-petclinic created
....

As previously mentioned for `services`, you could use the `oc expose` command:
....
oc expose svc/quarkus-petclinic -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
....

It is then time to access to our application using a web browser. To do so, let's first get the `host` where this application is exposed:

....
$ oc get route -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

NAME                HOST/PORT                                                  PATH   SERVICES            PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
quarkus-petclinic   quarkus-petclinic-user0.apps.labs.sandbox779.opentlc.com          quarkus-petclinic   8080-tcp                 None
....

Copy the value under `HOST/PORT` column in your preferred web browser. And then... there we go!

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first application.

Just a few  considerations about the application. This application requires access to a DB in order to persist any change. In this lab, we used an in-memory H2 DB within our application.. so in case you add/remove pets, this changes are only persisted to that single pod.

You would also notice that in case you kill/delete the pod, those pets previously created would have been lost.

Feel free to perform these very usefull exercises to understand that _pods are ephemeral_.

But no worries, *our pets deserve the best*.. so will deploy a proper DB in the next lab and link the application pods to it.
