:toc-title: Adding persistent volumes

[Abstract]
This lab will give you an overview about adding a persistence layer to any application that may require it, for instance, a Database.

In last lab, we have deployed an ephemeral Database, that means, in case the `pod` is recreated, any data previously stored will be lost.

Let's fix this!!

:numbered:
== Understanding storage

I would like you to spend some time to read the Openshift official documentation about storage and understand the main concepts around it: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html[Understanding persistent storage].

Or in case you just want the basics for the lab, just read the following:

- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html#persistent-volumes_understanding-persistent-storage[PersistentVolume]
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html#persistent-volumes_understanding-persistent-storage[PersistentVolumeClaim]

== Setting persistent storage to the Database

Let's now add persistent storage to the Postgresql Database we have deployed so we do not miss data in case our Database `pod` crashes or is recreated.

First, we will scale down to 0. You can use the `web console` or the `oc`. Here is the command:

....
$ oc scale dc/petclinic-database --replicas=0 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>


deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/petclinic-database scaled
....

Now, edit the `petclinic-database` `DeploymentConfig` to remove any `volume` and `volumeMount` reference to avoid conflicts when adding new storage. Before removing, keep save somewhere the path related to the volume mount. You can manually edit the `DeploymentConfig`  from the `web console` or by running:
....
 oc edit dc/petclinic-database  -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
....

Remove `emptyDir` volume:

Remove volume mount:

Let's add storage now. Move to the `Developer` view and click on the Database application and then, `Add storage`:

Chose `Create new claim` and set the values according to next picture:

Scale the Database `DeploymentConfig` back to one replica:

....
$ oc scale dc/petclinic-database --replicas=1 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>


deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/petclinic-database scaled
....

Do some extra checks:

- Have a look at the new `DeploymentConfig` volume and volumeMount section
- Navigate to the `web console` and `storage` menu and verify that the `pvc` appears as bound
- And try to get details about the `pv` (No, you won't get those details as your are not cluster administrator)

And also, test the application again. You will notice that we will get errors.. because the tables, relationships and data does not exist any more...

In order recreate our scheme, let's scale down the application to 0 and then back to 1 (this is because the application will create the tables and relationships again based on its hibernate configuration):

....
$ oc scale deployment/quarkus-petclinic --replicas=0 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic scaled
....

And once there is no `pods` for the application, scale it up again:

....
$ oc scale deployment/quarkus-petclinic --replicas=1 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic scaled
....

And test the application... and list the owners. You should get a list of pre-created veterinarians :-)

From now on.. you will not lose your data anymore as it is backed by a `PersistentVolume`.
