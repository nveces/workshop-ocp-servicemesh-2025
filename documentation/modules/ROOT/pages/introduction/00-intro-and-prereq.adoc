:toc-title: Lab 0 - Warming up

[Abstract]

WARNING: This is not a recommended practices guide nor intended to serve as a reference. These series of labs are oriented in such a way that you will have a first contact to the main concepts and how certain changes affects to the state of an application deployment.



In this preparation lab, we are going to introduce the Openshift web console, get the `oc` cli binary, and finally, validate that all necessary requirements are successfully accomplished before starting the series of labs. 

Along these labs, you will refer to a list of variables that have been shared with you before starting the labs. If this is not your case, please let us know. 

These variables are:

- *$OCP_CONSOLE*: url for accessing to the 
Openshift web console
- *$OCP_API*: Openshift API endpoint. We will use this endpoint when accesing the cluster from the `oc` cli.
- *$USER*: your private user id used for Openshift authentication
- *$PASSWORD*:  your secret password used for Openshift authentication

Feel free to export these variables in your environment.

There is also a list of files needed to run the labs. These files can be found in the following github repository:

https://github.com/dsanchor/ocp-intro-dev

Clone the repository to your desired location, that will then be referred as *$LABS_HOME* during the labs:

....
$ git clone https://github.com/dsanchor/ocp-intro-dev.git $LABS_HOME
....

== Access to Openshift Web Console

Use the `*$OCP_CONSOLE*` url to acces the Openshift Web Console. 

A login screen will be shown as follow:

Enter your `username` and `password` and click `Log In`.

If you have successfully logged in, you will arrive to the main dashboard with your current projects. As seen below, the list of projects should be empty:

We will soon create our first project, but now, it is time to get the Openshift CLI binaries for your specific OS. 

=> _Additional reads: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/web_console/web-console.html[Web Console]_

=== Download the CLI 

On the top-right (?) menu, click on `Command line tools`:

image:menu-clt.png[command-line-tools]

Then, choose the binaries according to your OS:

image:cli-download-options.png[cli-download-options]

Extract the binaries and try it by executing the following:

....
$ oc version

Client Version: openshift-clients-4.6.0-202006250705.p0-176-g5797eaeca
Server Version: 4.6.15
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+1833054
....

The above is an example of what you should get when running the command.

=== Login to Openshift using oc

Once we have the `oc` cli tool installed, we will first log in into the platform by running:

_Notice that we are using the $VARS we mentioned at the beggining of the labs. If you have not exported them, you will need to manually replace them below._

....
oc login -u $USER -p $PASSWORD $OCP_API

Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
....

There is not any project yet, so let's create it.


== Create your first project

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from others. 

In our labs, you will deploy the demo application and related into your own project. 

Also notice that sometimes we talk about   `namespaces`, which is the Kubernetes concept and others about `projects`. A `project` is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations.

=> _Additional reads: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/applications/projects/working-with-projects.html[working with projects]_ 

We are now ready to create our first project by running:

....
 $ oc new-project <YOUR_PROJECT>

Now using project "user0" on server "https://api.labs.sandbox779.opentlc.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
....

Well done! :-)

If you now move to the `Openshift Console`, under the `Administrator` view, you will notice that you have a new `Project`:

image:projects.png[projects]


We can now start deploying applications into our project.
