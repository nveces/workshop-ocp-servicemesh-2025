:toc-title: Configuration management

[Abstract]

In this lab, we will introduce the concepts of `ConfigMap` and `Secrets` and we will give some examples of how they can be used/consumed from any application.

:numbered:
== Short introduction

Before continue to the labs, I highly encourage you to read the following (brief) documentation about:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/[ConfigMaps]
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets]


== ConfigMaps

As a summary of what you have read in the k8s documentation, we will use a `ConfigMap` to separate the configuration from the container image. This approach will give us the possibility of running the same image in different environments and inject completely different configuration values per environment.

In the next example I will use the the `Terms and conditions` tab in our "Pet clinic" web site to externalize the content of this legal text. 

Before we start, let's update the image that is used during this lab:

....
oc set image deployment/quarkus-petclinic *=quay.io/dsanchor/quarkus-petclinic:config  -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic image updated
....

I would also suggest to scale the application down to 1 replicas for debugging simplicity during the lab.
....
oc scale deployment/quarkus-petclinic --replicas=1 -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic scaled
....

Back to the topic, the main difference with the other application versions is that, this version, will try to read from a _/deployments/tcs.txt_ (as per defined in https://github.com/dsanchor/petclinic/blob/mnl-config/quarkus-petclinic/src/main/resources/application.properties[application configration]) to load the content of the `Terms and conditions` text.

If you click now on the "T&Cs" tab, you will get a message like this one:

image:tcs.png[terms and conditions]

If you also check the `pod` logs, every time you click on "T&CS" tab, there will be a WARN log message:

....
WARN: no such file. Setting default T&Cs message
....

NOTE: you can also see the logs of your pod by running: oc get logs -f <POD> -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

Let's create our `ConfigMap` now:
....
 oc create cm terms-and-conditions --from-literal=tcs.txt="My new tcs" -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

 configmap/terms-and-conditions created
....

You can also check the content from the `web console`:

image:configmap-tcs.png[tcs configmap]

And now, let's mount this `ConfigMap` as volume in our `pods` by adding some configuration in the application `Deployment`:

....
oc set volume deployment/quarkus-petclinic --add --name=tcs -m /deployment -t configmap --configmap-name=terms-and-conditions -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

deployment.apps/quarkus-petclinic volume update
....

What this command has added in our `Deployment` is:

image:volume-mount-deployment.png[volume mount deployment]


If we now click on the "T&CS" tab, the content should be exactly the same of the one set in the `ConfigMap` and the WARN should have dissapeared from the `pod` logs:

image:new-tcs.png[new tcs]

What would happen if you modify the content of the `ConfigMap`? Are the 'T&CS' updated as well?

Feel free to try it your self. You could edit the `ConfigMap` manually from the `web console` or by running:
....
 oc edit cm terms-and-conditions -n <YOUR_PROJECT>
....

Both `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps` could be mounted as volumes within `pods`. 

Other approach that is valid in both cases is to consume the content of either `Secrets` or `ConfigMaps` as environment variables within `pods`.

We will see this last approach next with a `Secret` example.


== Secrets

Compare to `ConfigMaps`, `Secrets` are used to store and manage sensitive data. 

In this lab, we will just have a look at how the Postgresql application is using and consuming a given `Secret` that stores sensitive data such as the username, password and database name.

First of all, let's have a look at the `petclinic-database` `Secret` using either the `web console` or the `cli`. I will use the `cli`, focusing only on the interesting part of the 'Secret'

....
$ oc get secret petclinic-database -o yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT>

apiVersion: v1
data:
  database-name: cGV0Y2xpbmlj
  database-password: bXlzZWNyZXRwYXNzd29yZA==
  database-user: cGV0Y2xpbmlj
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: petclinic-database
....

Notice the main keys within the data part: database-name, database-password and database-user. 

Now, let's move to the postgresql `DeploymentConfig` and see how these keys are then referenced from the environment variables.

If we check it using the `web console`:

image:dcs-env-vars.png[dc env vars]

In the YAML descriptor, we can also clearly see how environments variables are set from the `Secret`:

image:yaml-env-vars.png[yaml env vars]

== Extra: how Quarkus (could) manage configuration

Once we have finished the whole lab, I would like to introduce you a different approach that is used by Quarkus in order to load/access `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets`.

As mentioned previously, some parts of the cofiguration has been profiled so that, we have different values for local development and production.

We would like to go a step further and show you how to make this application a Cloud Native one in terms of configuration.

Let me show it once we all have finished the lab.
