= Lab 5 - Requests Timeouts

== Introduction

A timeout for HTTP requests can be specified using the timeout field in the {vs}. By default, the timeout is 15 seconds, but in this task you override the _reviews_ service timeout to 1 second. 

To see its effect, however, you also introduce an artificial 2 second delay in calls to the _ratings_ service.

include::partials/deploy_bookinfo.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Adding a delay to ratings service

First, route requests to _reviews:v2_ service (a version that calls the ratings service).

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
----

Apply this change with this command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab5/vs-reviews-v2.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

Add a 2 second delay to calls to the ratings service:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: ratings
spec:
  hosts:
  - ratings
  http:
  - fault:
      delay:
        percent: 100
        fixedDelay: 2s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: ratings
        subset: v1
----

You can apply this change with this command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab5/vs-ratings-delay.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

include::partials/kiali_traffic_loop.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Make sure you select _Response Time_ in the _Show Edge Labels_ display options in Kiali:

.Kiali Response Time

Check the results in Kiali. You may notice a 2 second delay in the ratings call:

.Kiali Ratings service with 2s delay

If you visit the Bookinfo app with your browser you should see the Bookinfo application working normally (with ratings stars displayed), but there is a 2 second delay whenever you refresh the page:

https://<user>.bookinfo.<openshift_apps_domain>/productpage

== Adding a timeout to reviews service

Now add a half second request timeout for calls to the _reviews_ service:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
    timeout: 0.5s
----

You can apply this change with this command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab5/vs-reviews-timeout.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

By default the request timeout is disabled. Since the _reviews_ service subsequently calls the _ratings_ service when handling requests, you can use Istio to inject a 2 second delay in calls to _ratings_ to cause the _reviews_ service to take longer than half a second to complete and consequently you could see the timeout in action.

Refresh the Bookinfo web page in your browser:

https://<user>.bookinfo.<openshift_apps_domain>/productpage

You can observe that instead of displaying reviews, the Bookinfo product page (which calls the reviews service to populate the page) display the message: _Sorry, product reviews are currently unavailable for this book_. This was the result of it receiving the timeout error from the _reviews_ service.

You may have noticed that it returns in about 1 second, instead of 2, and the reviews are unavailable. The reason that the response takes 1 second, even though the timeout is configured at half a second, is because there is a hard-coded retry in the _productpage_ service, so it calls the timing out reviews service twice before returning.

Check the results in Kiali:

.Kiali Reviews service with timeout

== Hardcoded timeout in productpage service

If you examine the <<Lab 4 - Fault Injection>>, youâ€™ll find out that the productpage microservice also has its own application-level timeout (3 seconds) for calls to the _reviews_ microservice.

Notice that in this lab you used an Istio route rule to set the timeout to half a second. Had you instead set the timeout to something greater than 3 seconds (such as 4 seconds) the timeout would have had no effect since the more restrictive of the two takes precedence.
