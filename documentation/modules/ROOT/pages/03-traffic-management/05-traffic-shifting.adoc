= Lab 3 - Traffic Shifting and Weight Balancing

== Introduction

In this lab you will learn how to gradually migrate traffic from one version of a service to another.

For example, you might migrate traffic from an older version to a new version. In this example you will use _reviews:v1_ service as the old version and _reviews:v2_ service as the new version.

First you will deploy Bookinfo and then you will configure a sequence of rules that send 90% of traffic to _reviews:v1_ and 10% to _reviews:v2_. Then, you will continue the migration by sending 50% of traffic to each service and, finally, complete the migration sending 100% of the traffic to _reviews:v2_.

In this lab you will use 2 versions of the same service but you could create more complex routing rules weigth-balancing between many different versions of the same service or even different services.

== Route 10% of the traffic to a new service

The first modification to the _reviews_ {vs} to add a 90/10 routing rule looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 90 <1>
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 10 <2>
----

<1> 90% traffic to _reviews:v1_
<2> 10% traffic to _reviews:v2_

Note that the sum of weights across destinations should be == 100. If there is only one destination in a rule, the weight value is assumed to be 100.

You can apply it with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab3/vs-reviews-shifting-90-10.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

include::./../../partials/03-traffic-management/kiali_traffic_loop.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

Make sure you select _Request Percentage_ in the _Show Edge Labels_ display options in Kiali:

.Kiali Request Percentage

Check the results:

== Route half the traffic to each service

The _reviews_ {vs} to add a 50/50 routing rule will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 50 <1>
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 50 <2>
----

<1> 50% traffic to _reviews:v1_
<2> 50% traffic to _reviews:v2_

You can apply it with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab3/vs-reviews-shifting-50-50.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

include::./../../partials/03-traffic-management/kiali_traffic_loop.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

.Kiali traffic shifting 50/50
image:03-traffic-management/kiali-shifting-50-50.png[link=../_images/03-traffic-management/kiali-shifting-50-50.png,window=_blank]

== Route all the traffic to the new service

The _reviews_ {vs} to add a 100% routing rule to the new service will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 0 <1>
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 100 <2>
----

<1> 0% traffic to _reviews:v1_
<2> 100% traffic to _reviews:v2_

Note that we could have omitted the _reviews:v1_ _destination_ altogether as it is not receiving any traffic at all.

You can apply it with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab3/vs-reviews-shifting-0-100.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----
