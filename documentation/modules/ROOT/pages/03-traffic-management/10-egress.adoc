= Lab 8 - Egress Gateways

== Introduction

In this lab you are going to learn how to configure {ossm} to access external services from inside the applications.

Because all outbound traffic from an Istio-enabled pod is redirected to its sidecar proxy by default, accessibility of services outside of the cluster depends on the configuration of the proxy.

By default, Istio configures the Envoy proxy to pass through requests for unknown services.

{rhossm} can be configured with a special policy for handling external services, that is, those services that are not defined in Istioâ€™s internal service registry. 

If the policy is in permissive state (by default), the Istio proxy lets calls to unknown services pass through. If the policy is set to a restrictive state, then the Istio proxy blocks any host without a {se} defined within the mesh.

In this lab we have modified the Istio control plane to set the policy to a restrictive state.

== Accessing an external service

At this point you can test wether you can query a service outside the mesh.

For this lab, you are going to use a simple pod based in `ubi:latest` ({rh} Universal Base Image). This pod will be added to the mesh because it will have the Istio sidecar injected. It will be kept running by using a simple _sleep_ command:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubi
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubi
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
      labels:
        app: ubi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubi
        image: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
        command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
----

Then you will use this running pod to run commands inside it, like `curl`, and test wether you can reach outside services or not.

First, deploy this container by executing:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f ubi/ubi.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

Get the name of the pod:

[source,bash]
----
export UBI_POD=$(oc get pods --no-headers -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep ubi)
----

Check if you can query an external service from the _ubi_ pod:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -it ${UBI_POD} -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} -c ubi -- curl -I https://github.com
----

Ooops, you can't, because {ossm} is configured with a restrictive policy.

== Service Entry

As stated before, in a restrictive state we need to add any external service to Istio's internal registry.

You need to create a {se} for this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  hosts:
  - github.com <1>
  ports:
  - number: 443 <2>
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  resolution: DNS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  exportTo: [ ".", "istio-system" ] <3>
----
<1> The external service
<2> All necessary ports must be declared
<3> Limit the {se} to this namesapce and _istio-system_

Execute the following command to create the {se}:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f lab8/github-serviceentry.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

Now, check again if you can query an external service from the _ubi_ pod:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -it ${UBI_POD} -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} -c ubi -- curl -I https://github.com
----

.Accessing external service with {se}

So, this is now a controlled way to enable access to external services.

== Egress Gateway

In the previous example the external services are called directly from the client sidecar.

This example shows how to configure Istio to call external services, although this time indirectly via a dedicated {eg} service.

Istio uses Ingress and Egress Gateways to configure load balancers executing at the edge of a service mesh. An {ig} allows you to define entry points into the mesh that all incoming traffic flows through. An {eg} is a symmetrical concept; it defines exit points from the mesh.

{eg}s allow you to apply Istio features, for example, monitoring and route rules, to traffic exiting the mesh.

The first thing you need to configure an {eg} is a {gw} object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: github-egress
spec:
  selector:
    istio: egressgateway <1>
  servers:
  - hosts:
      - github.com <2>
    port:
      number: 443 <3>
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: PASSTHROUGH <4>
----
<1> This will match a label in the {eg} _Deployment_ inside the _istio-system_ control plane.
<2> The host you want to expose.
<3> This is the port to use in the {eg}, not to be confused with the target port of the external service.
<4> In this example you will _pass through_ TLS communications.

Create it with this command:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f lab8/github-egress-gateway.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

Then, you will have to create a {vs} to direct traffic from the sidecars to the {eg} and from the {eg} to the external service:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: github-egress
spec:
  hosts:
  - github.com <1>
  gateways: <2>
  - github-egress
  - mesh
  tls:
  - match: <3>
    - gateways:
      - mesh
      sniHosts:
      - github.com
    route:
    - destination:
        host: istio-egressgateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
      weight: 100
  - match: <4>
    - gateways:
      - github-egress
      sniHosts:
      - github.com
    route:
    - destination:
        host: github.com
      weight: 100
  exportTo: [ ".", "istio-system" ]
----
<1> This {vs} will be applied to this host.
<2> _mesh_ is a reserved word for sidecars. _github-egress_ match the name of the {gw}.
<3> The first match will route traffic from sidecars to the {eg}.
<4> The second match is to finally route traffic from the {eg} to the external service.

Create it with this command:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f lab8/github-egress-virtualservice.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----

Now, check again and simulate some traffic with this command:

[source,bash]
----
while true; do oc exec -it ${UBI_POD} -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE} -c ubi -- curl -I https://github.com ; done
----

In Kiali you can see this time that the traffic is going through the {eg}:

== Remove everything

Before starting the next lab, remove everything you have created in your namespace:

[source,bash]
----
oc delete -f ubi/ubi.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
oc delete -f lab8/github-serviceentry.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
oc delete -f lab8/github-egress-gateway.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
oc delete -f lab8/github-egress-virtualservice.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
----
