= Lab 7 - Mirroring and Dark Launches

== Introduction

Traffic mirroring, also called shadowing, is a powerful concept that allows feature teams to bring changes to production with as little risk as possible.

Mirroring sends a copy of live traffic to a mirrored service. The mirrored traffic happens out of band of the critical request path for the primary service.

In this lab, you will first force all traffic to _reviews:v1_ service. Then, you will apply a rule to mirror a portion of traffic to _reviews:v2_.

== Mirroring traffic to v2

The following {vs} sends 100% of the traffic to _reviews:v1_. The last stanza specifies that you want to mirror to the _reviews:v2_ service:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 100
    mirror:
      host: reviews
      subset: v2
    mirrorPercentage:
      value: 10.0 <1>
----

<1> You can use the _mirrorPercentage_ field to mirror a fraction of the traffic, instead of mirroring all requests. If this field is absent, for compatibility with older versions, all traffic will be mirrored. In this example, only the 10% of the traffic will be sent to the mirror service.

When traffic gets mirrored, the requests are sent to the mirrored service with their Host/Authority headers appended with _-shadow_. For example, _cluster-1_ becomes _cluster-1-shadow_.

Also, it is important to note that these requests are mirrored as "_fire and forget_", which means that the responses are discarded.

Apply the {vs} with this command:

[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f lab7/vs-reviews-mirroring.yaml -n ${OCP_NAMESPACE}
